# reportTemplate
This repository contains a template for how lab reports or assignments can be written in LaTeX. It contains some hints to useful packages for scientific writing. Originally, the template is written for the courses TTK4115 and TTK4135 at the Department of Engineering Cybernetics, NTNU, but we believe that it can be useful for a wider audience.
